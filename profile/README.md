Owl Duty is an open source self-hosted service to manage and schedule API tests. The project is in
development and you can follow the progress on our
[public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/owlduty/projects/1).

[sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/theredfish) his work.

## Self-hosted isn't for you?

Don't want the burden of a self-hosted solution? Then you can already pre-subscribe to our SaaS
<https://owlduty.com>. We will provide you the infrastructure, the scalability and the support.

You get the advantage of the open source solution with the benefits of our infrastructure.

## What's in the box?

- No code UI
- HTTP monitoring: check the health of your endpoints
- End-to-End HTTP tests: chain your calls and test critical user paths
- Multi-locations / nodes
- Alerting: emails / webhooks
